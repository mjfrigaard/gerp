`ger_name()` is designed to return a [tidyverse style](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#object-names) name for an object (i.e. variable). It works well for file names that have a date prefix: 

```{r date-prefix}
ger_name("1986-10-12_file.txt")
```

`ger_name()` replaces some symbols with abbreviations:

```{r all-abbreviations}
gerp::ger_name("~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * â€” = +")
```

But keeps the characters and words:

```{r abbreviations}
ger_name("20 % of this & that")
```

It will also reorganize crazy file names into something that can be assigned to R variables.

```{r crazy-names}
ger_name("123456 ! bingo + bongo")
```

To ensure the names aren't too long or repeat terms, `ger_name()` doesn't repeat symbols. 

```{r no-repeat}
gerp::ger_name("... !! ++")
```

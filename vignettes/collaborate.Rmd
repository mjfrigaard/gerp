## Creating a `gerp` project

Create a new `gerp` project:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
gerp::ger_proj(parent_dir = "/Users/<username>/", proj_name = "my new project")
```

```{r gerp-new-proj, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/gerp-new-proj.gif")
```


This also creates a `CITATION` file:

```         
Make the project citable (3e) by including a CITATION file in the project's home
directory that describes how to cite this project as a whole, and where to find
(and how to cite) any data sets, code, figures, and other artifacts that have 
their own DOIs.

```

A `requirements.md` file

```         
# Requirements 
==============

Make dependencies and requirements explicit. This is usually done on a 
per-project rather than per-program basis, i.e., by adding a file called 
something like requirements.txt to the root directory of the project

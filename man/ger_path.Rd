\item{type}{Return the relative or absolute path. The default is a relative path, which is the location of a file or folder \strong{relative to the current working directory (or folder)}. This means that it doesn't start with the root directory, but with the directory that you're currently in. Absolute paths are the exact location of a file or folder in the file system hierarchy. They begin with the root folder and includes all folders and subfolders necessary to locate the file or folder.}
